//Combine strings function
//
//  Create a function named combineNames/combine_names/CombineNames that accepts two parameters (first and last name). The function should return the full name.
//
//  Example:
//
//  With "James" as the first name and "Stevens" as the last name should return "James Stevens"

/*Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

  It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

  arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

  If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

  arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3] */
